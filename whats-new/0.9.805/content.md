## Introducing What's New

Lotti now greets you with release highlights when you update to a new version. No more wondering what changed — you'll see it right away.

- **Auto-shows on update** — The modal appears automatically when you launch an updated version
- **Magazine-style design** — Each release gets a featured banner and polished presentation
- **Swipe to explore** — Browse through multiple releases with smooth page transitions

---

## Smart Tracking

The modal remembers what you've seen:

- Only shows releases you haven't viewed yet
- Tracks which pages you actually visited
- Won't repeat itself when you reopen the app

Tap **Skip** to mark everything as read, or simply browse at your pace.
