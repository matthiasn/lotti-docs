# Link Your Tasks Together

Break down complex projects by connecting related tasks.

## Task Linking

You can now create relationships between tasks directly from the task detail view. This makes it easy to:

- **Break down big tasks** into smaller, manageable subtasks
- **Track dependencies** between related work items
- **Navigate your work** by following the links between tasks

Look for the new "Linked Tasks" section between the AI summary and your checklists.

## How It Works

Tap the menu icon to see your options:

- **Link existing task** — Search your tasks and connect one with a single tap
- **Create new linked task** — Instantly create a subtask that inherits the parent's category
- **Manage links** — Remove connections you no longer need

Links show direction so you always know the relationship: tasks you linked *to* vs tasks linked *from* elsewhere.

## Visual Status

Each linked task displays its completion status at a glance:

- Open tasks show a hollow circle
- Completed tasks show a filled checkmark
- Colors match the task's status for quick scanning

Tap any linked task to jump straight to it.
