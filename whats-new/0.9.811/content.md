# Smoother Onboarding

Getting started with AI is now faster and friendlier.

## Streamlined Prompts

The default Gemini setup now includes just 9 essential prompts instead of 18 — carefully selected for the best experience:

- **Gemini Pro** handles complex reasoning: checklists, coding prompts, image prompts
- **Gemini Flash** handles fast processing: transcription, task summaries, image analysis
- **Nano Banana Pro** handles image generation: cover art with reasoning mode

Less clutter, same power. Check out [this video](https://matthiasnehlsen.substack.com/p/ftue-improvements-on-linux) to see it in action.

## Flexible Setup Modal

The Gemini setup modal is now easier to dismiss:

- **Tap outside** to close it temporarily — it will reappear next launch
- **"Don't Show Again"** to dismiss it permanently

This lets you explore the app first and set up AI when you're ready.
