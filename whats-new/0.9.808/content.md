# Voice-Controlled Tasks

Set task properties while you speak — no typing required.

## Talk to Your Tasks

While recording audio notes, you can now set task properties using natural language. The AI understands what you mean and updates your task automatically.

- **Time estimates** — Say "this will take about two hours" and the estimate gets set
- **Due dates** — Say "I need to finish this by Friday" and the due date is assigned

Check out [this video](https://matthiasnehlsen.substack.com/p/ftue-improvements-on-linux) to see it in action.

## Smart Date Resolution

The AI understands relative dates and converts them to actual calendar dates:

- "next Tuesday" → the actual date
- "end of the month" → last day of current month
- "in two weeks" → 14 days from now

No need to think about specific dates while brainstorming.

## Respects Your Edits

Already set a due date or estimate manually? Voice commands won't overwrite them. The AI only fills in values that aren't already set, so your deliberate choices are preserved.
