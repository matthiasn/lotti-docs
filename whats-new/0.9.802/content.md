# Smoother Scrolling

We've made significant improvements to how Lotti handles long lists.

## Buttery Smooth Lists

Scrolling through tasks with lots of checklist items? You'll notice it feels much smoother now. We've optimized how the app renders content as you scroll:

- Task lists now preload content intelligently
- Entry details scroll more fluidly
- The labels modal handles large collections better

These changes target smooth 60fps (and 120fps on ProMotion displays).

## Battery Friendly

Fixed an issue where the calendar page could drain your battery even when idle. The app now uses significantly less CPU when you're not actively interacting with it.

Your device stays cooler, and your battery lasts longer.
