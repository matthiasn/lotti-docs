# Get Started with AI

New users can now set up AI features in just one tap.

## Gemini Quick Start

When you first launch Lotti without any AI providers configured, you'll see a friendly setup prompt. One tap gets you started with Gemini — Google's powerful AI that works great with Lotti.

- **Audio transcription** — Convert voice notes to text automatically
- **Image analysis** — Let AI describe and tag your photos
- **Smart checklists** — Generate task breakdowns from descriptions
- **Task summaries** — Get AI-powered insights on your progress

---

## Easy Setup

The setup modal appears after you've seen What's New, so nothing overlaps. Just tap to configure Gemini with optimized defaults — no manual configuration needed.

Not interested? Tap "Don't Show Again" and it won't ask again.

## More Options Available

Gemini is just the start. In **Settings > AI**, you can also configure:

- **Ollama** for local, private inference
- **OpenAI** and compatible providers
- Custom model configurations

Start simple with Gemini, expand later if you need to.
